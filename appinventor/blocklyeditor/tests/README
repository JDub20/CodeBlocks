To create a phantomJS test you will need to generate a project first, so that
you have access to an Screen1.scm and Screen1.bky files.

You will also have to install phantomJS: http://phantomjs.org/download.html

In MacOSX is as simple as: brew install phantomJS (if you are using homebew)
In other platforms just download the package and put the bin folder in your PATH


After that, create a new test following the template in this same folder called
yailGeneratorTest.template
The test will expect the two files mentioned above as test data, and also an
expected Yail string to assert against.

You can generate a project by using blocks in the browser, and then download the
zip file. Unzipping the file will reveal both scm and bky files.
While the project is open in the browser, you can right click on the main block
and choose 'Generate Yail'. You should copy that string to be used as the
expected value of the test.

For an Example, you can see the code in buttonClickTest.js, and the accompanying
files inside data/buttonClick.
