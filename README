Welcome to the Source code of MIT App Inventor.

You can learn more about MIT App Inventor at http://appinventor.mit.edu.

This code is designed to be run in Google's App Engine. MIT runs a
public instance that all are welcome to use to build App Inventor
Applications. You do not need to compile or use this code if you wish
to build MIT App Inventor applications.

We provide this code for reference and for experienced people who wish
to operate their own App Inventor instance.

To build: cd to appinventor and type "ant."

This code is tested and known to work with Sun Java 6. There are
issues with using OpenJDK.
